# Work Examples

## UMN Transit Map

I produced this map as a part of my Geovisualization class this semester. The legend was designed to be
interactive, so the user could hover their cursor over the circle and information about each route/legend item would pop up.

## Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter notebook was created from scratch as a part of an ArcGIS I exercise. It walks through how to set up, view files,
and use a geoprocessing tool to create a new feature class.
