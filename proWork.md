# Work Examples

## UMN Transit Map

I produced this map as a part of my Geovisualization class this semester. The legend was designed to be
interactive, so the user could hover their cursor over the circle and information about each route/legend item would pop up. This map was made using Processing, an open-source graphical library and IDE.

Skills:
  * Cartographic principles
  * Map abstraction
  * Java

## Geospatial Commons

My work for MnGeo includes updating datasets on the Minnesota Geospatial Commons. These are a few examples of datasets that I have worked with; I am listed as the metadata contact for these and other datasets.

## Undergraduate Honors Thesis

As a part of my computer science degree, I did research and wrote an honors thesis. I developed an algorithm that gathered farmfields found in OpenStreetMap and exported them to a shapefile, and then ran a clustering analysis on the shapefile to discover how the location of farmfields are related to urban areas.

and use a geoprocessing tool to create a new feature class.
